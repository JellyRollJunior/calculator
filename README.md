# Calculator
Calculator to practice JS CSS HTML
- The Odin Project: [Lesson link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)
- I had a lot of fun doing this calculator project. I think my JavaScript skills are fine (due to my schooling) but I would like to further develop my HTML skills and mainly my CSS skills

### Learning outcomes
- Practiced flexbox 
  - (I would like to improve my flexbox skills)
  - I had a hard time figuring out how to make the display screen expand
  - I am not 100% confident in what changing the flex box values will do. I noticed I am doing a bit of a trial and error process to get the desired look I want. I want to be able to know how changing a value will affect the UI before even writing the change.
- Practiced option chaining
